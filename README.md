# simulated-anealing
We use the simulated annealing algorithm to minimize functions  in scilab

First we minimize the dimension 2 Griewank function.

G = (x^2)/50 + (y^2)/50 - (cos(x)+1)*(cos(y/sqrt(2))+1);

The minimum found is - 4 and is reached in point (0,0).

We also used the algorithm in multiobjective optimization
